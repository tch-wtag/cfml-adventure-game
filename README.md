## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Place it in your CFML server’s webroot (for example:  
   `C:\ColdFusion2023\cfusion\wwwroot` or `Lucee\tomcat\webapps\ROOT`).  
3. Visit:  
   **http://127.0.0.1:8888/adventure.cfm**  
4. Play the game — explore scenes, collect items, and manage your progress.

## 🧠 Technical Notes
- Session-based state management (`session.gameState`)
- REST-like API in `/api/state.cfm` handles:
  - **GET** → Load saved game  
  - **POST** → Save game  
  - **DELETE** → Start a new game
- Story content is loaded from `story.json` via `components/Game.cfc`
